Killy is moving alone in a narrow dark labyrinth full of unseen creatures of the Underworld. And at the darkest moment when he almost left his hope, he sees the tree growing through the dungeon ceiling straight to the sky. The tree is imprisoned in a huge metal chain. Killy chops the chain and the Tree starts speaking to him promising to fulfil one wish.
Killy wishes to have a pair of wings. The wings start to grow from his back immediately and he flies away from the dungeon through the hole in the ceiling.
